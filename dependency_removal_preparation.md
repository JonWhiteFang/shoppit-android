# Dependency Removal Preparation - Summary

**Date:** October 31, 2025

## Task 1.1: Current Dependency State

### Dependency Tree Generated
- Command executed: `./gradlew app:dependencies`
- Output saved to: `dependencies_before.txt`

### Current Versions Found

#### Netty Dependencies
Found in dependency tree (via grpc-netty and Android emulator tools):
- `io.netty:netty-codec-http2:4.1.93.Final`
- `io.netty:netty-common:4.1.93.Final`
- `io.netty:netty-buffer:4.1.93.Final`
- `io.netty:netty-transport:4.1.93.Final`

**Source:** These appear to be transitive dependencies from Android build tools and gRPC, NOT from CameraX or ML Kit as originally suspected.

#### Protobuf Dependencies
Found in dependency tree:
- `com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java:3.22.3`

**Source:** These appear to be transitive dependencies from Android build tools (ddmlib, UTP test plugins), NOT from CameraX or ML Kit as originally suspected.

### Important Finding
The Netty and Protobuf dependencies found in the current dependency tree are **NOT** coming from CameraX or ML Kit Barcode Scanning. They are transitive dependencies from:
- Android build tools (ddmlib, UTP)
- gRPC (for emulator control)

This means removing CameraX and ML Kit dependencies may **NOT** eliminate these Netty and Protobuf vulnerabilities, as they come from other sources.

## Task 1.2: Build Configuration Backups

### Backups Created
✅ `app/build.gradle.kts` → `app/build.gradle.kts.backup`
✅ `gradle/libs.versions.toml` → `gradle/libs.versions.toml.backup`

Both backup files verified and exist.

## Task 1.3: Code Reference Verification

### Search Results
All searches returned **ZERO matches** - confirming no code references exist:

✅ `import androidx.camera` - **0 matches**
✅ `import com.google.mlkit.vision.barcode` - **0 matches**
✅ `CameraX` keyword - **0 matches**
✅ `barcode` keyword - **0 matches**
✅ `scanner` keyword - **0 matches**

### Conclusion
**Confirmed:** No Kotlin source files reference CameraX or ML Kit Barcode Scanning libraries. The dependencies are completely unused in the codebase.

## Next Steps

Task 1 is complete. Ready to proceed with:
- Task 2: Remove dependencies from build configuration
- Task 3: Verify build and dependencies
- Task 4: Run security scan

## Important Note for Security Scan

When running the security scan after dependency removal, we should verify:
1. Whether CameraX/ML Kit dependencies are actually present (they may not be in the current build)
2. Whether Netty/Protobuf vulnerabilities remain (they likely will, as they come from Android build tools)
3. The actual source of any remaining vulnerabilities

The original assumption that Netty/Protobuf come from CameraX/ML Kit may need to be re-evaluated based on the dependency tree analysis.
