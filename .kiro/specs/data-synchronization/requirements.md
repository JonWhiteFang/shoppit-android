# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Data Synchronization feature enables Shoppit users to back up their meal library, meal plans, and shopping lists to the cloud and synchronize data across multiple devices. This feature ensures data persistence beyond local storage and provides seamless multi-device experiences while maintaining the app's offline-first architecture.

## Glossary

- **Sync Engine**: The system component responsible for coordinating data synchronization between local storage and cloud backend
- **Conflict Resolution**: The process of determining which version of data to keep when the same entity has been modified on multiple devices
- **Last-Write-Wins (LWW)**: A conflict resolution strategy where the most recently modified version of data is kept
- **Sync Status**: The current state of synchronization (idle, syncing, error, success)
- **Cloud Backend**: Remote server infrastructure that stores user data
- **Authentication Service**: System that manages user identity and access tokens
- **Local Database**: Room database storing user data on the device
- **Sync Metadata**: Additional data fields tracking modification timestamps and sync status

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create an account and sign in, so that I can back up my data to the cloud

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the app for the first time, THE Sync Engine SHALL display an option to create an account or sign in
2. WHEN the user provides valid credentials, THE Authentication Service SHALL authenticate the user and store access tokens securely
3. WHEN authentication succeeds, THE Sync Engine SHALL initiate an initial data sync
4. WHEN the user signs out, THE Sync Engine SHALL clear access tokens and stop automatic synchronization
5. WHERE the user chooses to skip authentication, THE Sync Engine SHALL allow full offline functionality without cloud backup

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my meals, meal plans, and shopping lists automatically backed up to the cloud, so that I don't lose my data if I lose my device

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user creates or modifies a meal, THE Sync Engine SHALL queue the change for cloud synchronization
2. WHEN the user creates or modifies a meal plan, THE Sync Engine SHALL queue the change for cloud synchronization
3. WHEN the user modifies a shopping list item, THE Sync Engine SHALL queue the change for cloud synchronization
4. WHEN network connectivity is available, THE Sync Engine SHALL upload queued changes to the Cloud Backend within 30 seconds
5. WHEN the Cloud Backend confirms successful upload, THE Sync Engine SHALL mark the local data as synchronized

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access my data on multiple devices, so that I can plan meals on my tablet and shop with my phone

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user signs in on a new device, THE Sync Engine SHALL download all user data from the Cloud Backend
2. WHEN remote data is downloaded, THE Sync Engine SHALL merge it with any existing local data
3. WHEN the app starts with network connectivity, THE Sync Engine SHALL check for remote changes and download updates
4. WHEN remote changes are detected, THE Sync Engine SHALL update the Local Database with new or modified entities
5. WHILE the app is running with network connectivity, THE Sync Engine SHALL poll for remote changes every 5 minutes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work offline and sync when I'm back online, so that I can use it anywhere without worrying about connectivity

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity is unavailable, THE Sync Engine SHALL queue all changes locally
2. WHEN network connectivity is restored, THE Sync Engine SHALL automatically resume synchronization
3. WHILE offline, THE Local Database SHALL serve all data requests without degradation
4. WHEN sync fails due to network issues, THE Sync Engine SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 5 attempts
5. WHEN the user performs actions offline, THE Sync Engine SHALL display sync status indicating pending changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want conflicts resolved automatically when I edit the same data on different devices, so that I don't have to manually merge changes

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the same entity is modified on multiple devices, THE Sync Engine SHALL detect the conflict during synchronization
2. WHEN a conflict is detected, THE Sync Engine SHALL apply Last-Write-Wins resolution based on modification timestamps
3. WHEN conflict resolution completes, THE Sync Engine SHALL update the Local Database with the winning version
4. WHEN the losing version is discarded, THE Sync Engine SHALL log the conflict for potential user review
5. WHERE timestamps are identical, THE Sync Engine SHALL use the server version as the winning version

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the sync status, so that I know when my data is backed up

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sync is in progress, THE Sync Engine SHALL display a syncing indicator in the UI
2. WHEN sync completes successfully, THE Sync Engine SHALL display a success indicator for 3 seconds
3. WHEN sync fails, THE Sync Engine SHALL display an error message with retry option
4. WHEN changes are pending sync, THE Sync Engine SHALL display a pending indicator
5. WHERE the user is offline, THE Sync Engine SHALL display an offline indicator with pending change count

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manually trigger a sync, so that I can ensure my latest changes are backed up before going offline

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user triggers manual sync, THE Sync Engine SHALL immediately start synchronization regardless of schedule
2. WHEN manual sync is triggered while offline, THE Sync Engine SHALL display an error message indicating no connectivity
3. WHEN manual sync completes, THE Sync Engine SHALL display a confirmation message
4. WHILE sync is in progress, THE Sync Engine SHALL disable the manual sync trigger
5. WHEN manual sync fails, THE Sync Engine SHALL display the error reason and offer retry option

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication to remain secure, so that my data is protected from unauthorized access

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication Service SHALL store access tokens using Android Keystore encryption
2. WHEN access tokens expire, THE Authentication Service SHALL automatically refresh them using refresh tokens
3. WHEN token refresh fails, THE Authentication Service SHALL prompt the user to sign in again
4. THE Sync Engine SHALL include authentication tokens in all API requests to the Cloud Backend
5. WHEN the Cloud Backend returns unauthorized errors, THE Sync Engine SHALL clear tokens and prompt re-authentication
