# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for implementing comprehensive error handling and input validation across the Shoppit Android application. The system will provide robust error management, user-friendly error messages, input validation for all user-facing forms, and graceful degradation when errors occur. This ensures a reliable user experience and prevents data corruption or application crashes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear error messages when something goes wrong, so that I understand what happened and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs in any operation, THE Shoppit_App SHALL display a user-friendly Error_Message describing the error condition
2. WHEN a Network_Error occurs, THE Shoppit_App SHALL display a message indicating network connectivity issues
3. WHEN a Database_Error occurs, THE Shoppit_App SHALL display a message indicating data storage issues
4. WHEN a Validation_Error occurs, THE Shoppit_App SHALL display a message indicating which Input_Field contains invalid data
5. THE Shoppit_App SHALL NOT display technical error details or stack traces to the User

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to retry failed operations, so that I can recover from temporary errors without restarting the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Network_Error occurs during data loading, THE Shoppit_App SHALL provide a Retry_Action button
2. WHEN the User triggers a Retry_Action, THE Shoppit_App SHALL re-attempt the failed operation
3. WHEN a retry succeeds, THE Shoppit_App SHALL display the requested data and remove the Error_State
4. WHEN a retry fails, THE Shoppit_App SHALL display the Error_Message again with the Retry_Action available

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to validate my input before saving, so that I don't accidentally create invalid data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the User enters data into an Input_Field, THE Validator SHALL check the data against defined validation rules
2. WHEN the User attempts to save a meal with an empty name field, THE Shoppit_App SHALL display a Validation_Error message stating "Meal name cannot be empty"
3. WHEN the User attempts to save a meal with a name exceeding 100 characters, THE Shoppit_App SHALL display a Validation_Error message stating "Meal name must be less than 100 characters"
4. WHEN the User attempts to save a meal with no ingredients, THE Shoppit_App SHALL display a Validation_Error message stating "Meal must have at least one ingredient"
5. WHEN the User attempts to save an ingredient with an empty name, THE Shoppit_App SHALL display a Validation_Error message stating "Ingredient name cannot be empty"
6. WHEN the User attempts to save an ingredient with a non-numeric quantity, THE Shoppit_App SHALL display a Validation_Error message stating "Quantity must be a valid number"
7. WHEN the User attempts to save an ingredient with a quantity less than or equal to zero, THE Shoppit_App SHALL display a Validation_Error message stating "Quantity must be greater than zero"

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want validation errors to appear next to the relevant input fields, so that I can quickly identify and fix the issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Validation_Error occurs for an Input_Field, THE Shoppit_App SHALL display the Error_Message directly below the Input_Field
2. WHEN a Validation_Error occurs for an Input_Field, THE Shoppit_App SHALL highlight the Input_Field with an error color
3. WHEN the User corrects invalid input in an Input_Field, THE Shoppit_App SHALL remove the Validation_Error message and error highlighting
4. THE Shoppit_App SHALL display all Validation_Error messages simultaneously for multiple invalid Input_Fields

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to continue working offline when network errors occur, so that I can still use core features without internet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Network_Error occurs during data synchronization, THE Shoppit_App SHALL continue displaying locally cached data
2. WHEN a Network_Error occurs during data synchronization, THE Shoppit_App SHALL display a Snackbar message indicating "Unable to sync. Using offline data."
3. WHEN the User creates or modifies data while offline, THE Shoppit_App SHALL save the data locally and mark it for synchronization
4. WHEN network connectivity is restored, THE Shoppit_App SHALL automatically attempt to synchronize pending changes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all exceptions to be caught and mapped at repository boundaries, so that errors are handled consistently across the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Repository_Layer SHALL catch all exceptions thrown by data sources
2. THE Repository_Layer SHALL map caught exceptions to typed domain errors using the Error_Handler
3. THE Repository_Layer SHALL return Result objects containing either success data or typed errors
4. THE Repository_Layer SHALL NOT allow exceptions to propagate to the Domain_Layer or UI_Layer
5. THE Error_Handler SHALL map SQLiteException to Database_Error with appropriate Error_Message
6. THE Error_Handler SHALL map IOException to Network_Error with appropriate Error_Message
7. THE Error_Handler SHALL map SocketTimeoutException to timeout-specific Network_Error with appropriate Error_Message

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want validation to occur in use cases before repository calls, so that invalid data never reaches the data layer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Domain_Layer SHALL validate all input data before invoking Repository_Layer operations
2. WHEN validation fails in a use case, THE use case SHALL return a Result containing a Validation_Error
3. WHEN validation succeeds in a use case, THE use case SHALL proceed with the Repository_Layer operation
4. THE Domain_Layer SHALL NOT invoke Repository_Layer operations when validation fails

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see loading indicators when operations are in progress, so that I know the app is working and not frozen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a data loading operation begins, THE Shoppit_App SHALL display a loading indicator
2. WHEN a data loading operation completes successfully, THE Shoppit_App SHALL hide the loading indicator and display the data
3. WHEN a data loading operation fails, THE Shoppit_App SHALL hide the loading indicator and display an Error_State
4. WHEN a data saving operation is in progress, THE Shoppit_App SHALL disable the save button and display a saving indicator

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want brief success messages when I complete actions, so that I have confirmation that my actions were successful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the User successfully saves a meal, THE Shoppit_App SHALL display a Snackbar message stating "Meal saved successfully"
2. WHEN the User successfully deletes a meal, THE Shoppit_App SHALL display a Snackbar message stating "Meal deleted"
3. WHEN the User successfully adds a meal to the planner, THE Shoppit_App SHALL display a Snackbar message stating "Meal added to plan"
4. THE Shoppit_App SHALL automatically dismiss success Snackbar messages after 2 seconds

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all errors to be logged with context, so that I can diagnose issues reported by users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Error_Handler SHALL log all errors using Timber with appropriate log levels
2. THE Error_Handler SHALL log Validation_Error instances at warning level with error details
3. THE Error_Handler SHALL log Network_Error instances at error level with error details and context
4. THE Error_Handler SHALL log Database_Error instances at error level with error details and context
5. THE Error_Handler SHALL include the component name or context in all log messages
6. WHERE the build is a release build, THE Error_Handler SHALL send error reports to a crash reporting service
