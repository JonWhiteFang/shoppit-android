# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Meal Management feature provides core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing meals in the Shoppit application. Users can create meals with ingredient lists, view their meal library, edit existing meals, and delete meals they no longer need. This feature forms the foundation for meal planning and shopping list generation.

## Glossary

- **Meal_System**: The subsystem responsible for managing meal data and operations
- **Meal_Entity**: A meal record containing name, ingredients list, and optional metadata
- **Ingredient_Item**: A component of a meal with name, quantity, and unit fields
- **Meal_Repository**: Data access layer interface for meal persistence operations
- **Room_Database**: Local SQLite database for offline meal storage
- **User_Interface**: Jetpack Compose screens for meal interaction
- **Validation_Service**: Component that validates meal data before persistence

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create new meals with ingredient lists, so that I can build my meal library for planning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user submits a new meal form, THE Meal_System SHALL validate that the meal name contains at least one non-whitespace character
2. WHEN the user submits a new meal form, THE Meal_System SHALL validate that at least one Ingredient_Item is included
3. WHEN validation passes, THE Meal_System SHALL persist the Meal_Entity to Room_Database with a unique identifier
4. WHEN the meal is successfully saved, THE Meal_System SHALL display a confirmation message to the user
5. IF the meal name already exists in Room_Database, THEN THE Meal_System SHALL allow creation with a duplicate name warning

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view all my saved meals, so that I can browse my meal library and select meals for planning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the meal list screen, THE Meal_System SHALL retrieve all Meal_Entity records from Room_Database
2. THE Meal_System SHALL display meals in alphabetical order by name
3. THE Meal_System SHALL show each meal's name and ingredient count in the list view
4. WHEN the Room_Database contains zero meals, THE Meal_System SHALL display an empty state message with guidance to add meals
5. WHEN the user taps a meal in the list, THE Meal_System SHALL navigate to the meal detail screen

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view detailed information about a meal, so that I can see the complete ingredient list and notes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens a meal detail screen, THE Meal_System SHALL retrieve the specific Meal_Entity from Room_Database by identifier
2. THE Meal_System SHALL display the meal name, complete ingredient list with quantities and units, and any optional notes
3. THE Meal_System SHALL provide an edit action button on the detail screen
4. THE Meal_System SHALL provide a delete action button on the detail screen
5. IF the Meal_Entity is not found in Room_Database, THEN THE Meal_System SHALL display an error message and navigate back

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit existing meals, so that I can update recipes and correct mistakes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the edit meal screen, THE Meal_System SHALL pre-populate the form with existing Meal_Entity data
2. WHEN the user modifies meal data and submits, THE Meal_System SHALL validate the updated data using Validation_Service
3. WHEN validation passes, THE Meal_System SHALL update the Meal_Entity in Room_Database preserving the original identifier
4. WHEN the update succeeds, THE Meal_System SHALL display a confirmation message and navigate to the detail screen
5. THE Meal_System SHALL allow the user to add, remove, or modify Ingredient_Item entries during editing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete meals I no longer need, so that I can keep my meal library organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user initiates a delete action, THE Meal_System SHALL display a confirmation dialog with the meal name
2. WHEN the user confirms deletion, THE Meal_System SHALL remove the Meal_Entity from Room_Database
3. WHEN deletion succeeds, THE Meal_System SHALL display a confirmation message and navigate to the meal list screen
4. WHEN the user cancels the deletion dialog, THE Meal_System SHALL dismiss the dialog without removing the Meal_Entity
5. THE Meal_System SHALL complete the deletion operation within 500 milliseconds under normal conditions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add multiple ingredients to a meal, so that I can create complete recipes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is creating or editing a meal, THE Meal_System SHALL provide an interface to add Ingredient_Item entries
2. THE Meal_System SHALL validate that each Ingredient_Item has a non-empty name field
3. THE Meal_System SHALL allow quantity and unit fields to be optional for Ingredient_Item entries
4. THE Meal_System SHALL allow the user to remove any Ingredient_Item from the list before saving
5. THE Meal_System SHALL support adding at least 50 Ingredient_Item entries per Meal_Entity

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work offline, so that I can manage my meals without an internet connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Meal_System SHALL perform all CRUD operations using Room_Database without requiring network connectivity
2. WHEN the device is offline, THE Meal_System SHALL provide full meal management functionality
3. THE Meal_System SHALL persist all meal data locally in Room_Database
4. THE Meal_System SHALL load meal data from Room_Database on app launch within 2 seconds
5. THE Meal_System SHALL maintain data consistency across app restarts and device reboots

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages when something goes wrong, so that I understand what happened and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a validation error occurs, THE Meal_System SHALL display a specific error message identifying the invalid field
2. WHEN a database operation fails, THE Meal_System SHALL display a user-friendly error message without technical details
3. THE Meal_System SHALL log detailed error information for debugging purposes
4. WHEN an unexpected error occurs, THE Meal_System SHALL display a generic error message and allow the user to retry
5. THE Meal_System SHALL clear error messages when the user corrects the input or retries the operation
