# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Project Setup feature establishes the foundational architecture and infrastructure for the Shoppit Android application. This includes setting up the Clean Architecture layers, configuring dependency injection with Hilt, establishing the Room database foundation, and organizing the project structure according to modern Android development best practices.

## Glossary

- **Shoppit_System**: The Android meal planning and shopping list application
- **Clean_Architecture**: Architectural pattern with distinct layers (Presentation, Domain, Data)
- **Hilt_Container**: Dependency injection framework for managing object creation and lifecycle
- **Room_Database**: Local SQLite database abstraction layer for offline-first data storage
- **Gradle_Module**: Build configuration system for managing dependencies and build variants
- **Material3_Theme**: Google's latest design system for consistent UI components

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured Android project foundation, so that I can build scalable and maintainable features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Shoppit_System SHALL implement Clean Architecture with distinct presentation, domain, and data layers
2. THE Shoppit_System SHALL use Hilt_Container for dependency injection across all layers
3. THE Shoppit_System SHALL configure Gradle_Module with all required dependencies for Jetpack Compose, Room, and networking
4. THE Shoppit_System SHALL establish package structure following Clean Architecture principles
5. THE Shoppit_System SHALL include Material3_Theme configuration for consistent UI styling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper dependency management, so that I can ensure consistent library versions and avoid conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Shoppit_System SHALL define all library versions in a centralized version catalog
2. THE Shoppit_System SHALL include Jetpack Compose BOM for UI component version alignment
3. THE Shoppit_System SHALL configure Room_Database dependencies with KSP annotation processing
4. THE Shoppit_System SHALL include Hilt_Container dependencies for compile-time dependency injection
5. THE Shoppit_System SHALL configure Retrofit and OkHttp dependencies for future network operations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a configured Room database foundation, so that I can implement offline-first data persistence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Shoppit_System SHALL create AppDatabase class extending RoomDatabase
2. THE Shoppit_System SHALL configure database with proper TypeConverters for complex data types
3. THE Shoppit_System SHALL implement database module in Hilt_Container for dependency injection
4. THE Shoppit_System SHALL establish database versioning strategy for future migrations
5. THE Shoppit_System SHALL configure database for testing with in-memory implementation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling infrastructure, so that I can manage failures consistently across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Shoppit_System SHALL define AppError sealed class for typed error handling
2. THE Shoppit_System SHALL implement AppResult type alias for consistent result wrapping
3. THE Shoppit_System SHALL create base UseCase abstract class for domain layer operations
4. THE Shoppit_System SHALL establish error mapping utilities for different layer boundaries
5. THE Shoppit_System SHALL configure logging framework for debugging and monitoring

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want testing infrastructure setup, so that I can write comprehensive tests for all layers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Shoppit_System SHALL configure JUnit and MockK dependencies for unit testing
2. THE Shoppit_System SHALL include Compose testing dependencies for UI testing
3. THE Shoppit_System SHALL configure Hilt testing modules for dependency injection in tests
4. THE Shoppit_System SHALL establish test database configuration with Room testing utilities
5. THE Shoppit_System SHALL create base test classes for common testing patterns
