# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for updating all Shoppit project documentation to align with current project standards, architecture patterns, and best practices. The documentation update will ensure consistency across all docs, incorporate missing topics from steering rules, and provide comprehensive guidance for developers.

## Glossary

- **Documentation System**: The complete set of markdown files in the `docs/` directory and root-level documentation files
- **Steering Rules**: Project-specific guidelines stored in `.kiro/steering/` that define standards and patterns
- **Documentation Index**: The `docs/INDEX.md` file that provides navigation and organization for all documentation
- **Root Documentation**: Documentation files at the project root level (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md)
- **Architecture Documentation**: Files in `docs/architecture/` describing system design and patterns
- **Guide Documentation**: Files in `docs/guides/` providing how-to instructions and workflows
- **Reference Documentation**: Files in `docs/reference/` containing quick lookup information
- **Setup Documentation**: Files in `docs/setup/` describing implementation details

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Documentation Index indicates pending documentation, THE Documentation System SHALL create those missing files
2. THE Documentation System SHALL include a comprehensive testing guide based on testing-strategy.md
3. THE Documentation System SHALL include a git workflow guide based on git-workflow.md
4. THE Documentation System SHALL include a Compose patterns guide based on compose-patterns.md

6. THE Documentation System SHALL include a code style guide based on structure.md conventions
7. THE Documentation System SHALL include database schema documentation
8. THE Documentation System SHALL include a comprehensive API reference

### Requirement 6: Documentation Accessibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want easily accessible documentation, so that I can reference it while coding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing documentation in a markdown viewer, THE Documentation System SHALL render correctly with proper formatting
2. THE Documentation System SHALL include working hyperlinks between related documentation files
3. WHEN searching for specific patterns, THE Documentation System SHALL include searchable code examples with clear labels
4. THE Documentation System SHALL provide quick reference sections for frequently used patterns
5. WHEN documentation includes diagrams, THE Documentation System SHALL use Mermaid syntax for version-controllable diagrams

### Requirement 7: Documentation Maintenance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want documentation that's easy to maintain, so that it stays current as the project evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Documentation System SHALL include guidelines for when and how to update documentation
2. WHEN adding new features, THE Documentation System SHALL provide clear instructions on which documentation files to update
3. THE Documentation System SHALL include a documentation status table showing completeness of each section
4. THE Documentation System SHALL use modular organization to minimize update scope when changes occur
5. WHEN documentation becomes outdated, THE Documentation System SHALL provide clear indicators of what needs updating

### Requirement 8: Root Documentation Updates

**User Story:** As a developer, I want accurate root-level documentation, so that I can quickly understand the project and get started.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing README.md, THE Root Documentation SHALL provide an accurate project overview, tech stack, and quick start guide
