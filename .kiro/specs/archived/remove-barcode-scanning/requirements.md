# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for removing the barcode scanning feature from the Shoppit Android application. The barcode scanning functionality was added as dependencies (CameraX and ML Kit Barcode Scanning) but has not been implemented in the codebase. These dependencies introduce security vulnerabilities through transitive dependencies (Netty and Protobuf) and add unnecessary complexity to the project.

## Glossary

- **CameraX**: Android Jetpack library for camera functionality
- **ML Kit**: Google's machine learning SDK for mobile applications
- **Barcode Scanning**: ML Kit component for detecting and decoding barcodes
- **Transitive Dependency**: A dependency that is pulled in indirectly through another dependency
- **Netty**: Network application framework (transitive dependency with known vulnerabilities)
- **Protobuf**: Protocol Buffers serialization library (transitive dependency with known vulnerabilities)
- **Build Configuration**: Gradle files that define project dependencies and build settings
- **Version Catalog**: Centralized dependency version management in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove Barcode Scanning Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused barcode scanning dependencies from the project, so that the application has a smaller footprint and fewer security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build configuration is updated, THE Build System SHALL remove the ML Kit Barcode Scanning dependency from `app/build.gradle.kts`
2. WHEN the build configuration is updated, THE Build System SHALL remove all CameraX dependencies from `app/build.gradle.kts`
3. WHEN the version catalog is updated, THE Build System SHALL remove the barcode-scanning version reference from `gradle/libs.versions.toml`
4. WHEN the version catalog is updated, THE Build System SHALL remove the camerax version reference from `gradle/libs.versions.toml`
5. WHEN the version catalog is updated, THE Build System SHALL remove all CameraX library definitions from `gradle/libs.versions.toml`
6. WHEN the version catalog is updated, THE Build System SHALL remove the ML Kit Barcode Scanning library definition from `gradle/libs.versions.toml`

### Requirement 2: Update Security Documentation

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want the security documentation to reflect the removal of barcode scanning dependencies, so that the current security posture is accurately documented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are removed, THE Documentation System SHALL update `SECURITY_ISSUES.md` to reflect the removal of CameraX and ML Kit dependencies
2. WHEN dependencies are removed, THE Documentation System SHALL document that Netty and Protobuf vulnerabilities are resolved through dependency removal
3. WHEN dependencies are removed, THE Documentation System SHALL update the accepted risks section to remove barcode-scanning-related entries
4. WHEN dependencies are removed, THE Documentation System SHALL add a new entry documenting the dependency removal decision and date

### Requirement 3: Verify Clean Build

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the project builds successfully after removing dependencies, so that I can confirm no code depends on the removed libraries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Gradle sync is executed, THE Build System SHALL complete successfully without errors
2. WHEN the clean build command is executed, THE Build System SHALL compile all source code without missing dependency errors
3. WHEN the dependency tree is generated, THE Build System SHALL not include CameraX or ML Kit Barcode Scanning dependencies
4. WHEN the dependency tree is generated, THE Build System SHALL not include Netty or Protobuf as transitive dependencies from CameraX or ML Kit

### Requirement 4: Run Security Scan

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want to run a security scan after removing dependencies, so that I can verify the vulnerabilities are resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SCA scan is executed, THE Security Scanner SHALL complete analysis of all project dependencies
2. WHEN the SCA scan results are reviewed, THE Security Scanner SHALL not report Netty vulnerabilities from CameraX or ML Kit sources
3. WHEN the SCA scan results are reviewed, THE Security Scanner SHALL not report Protobuf vulnerabilities from CameraX or ML Kit sources
4. WHEN the scan is complete, THE Documentation System SHALL update `SECURITY_ISSUES.md` with the new scan results and date

### Requirement 5: Update Project Documentation

**User Story:** As a team member, I want project documentation to reflect that barcode scanning is not a supported feature, so that future developers understand the project scope.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHERE product documentation exists, THE Documentation System SHALL update feature lists to exclude barcode scanning
2. WHERE dependency documentation exists, THE Documentation System SHALL remove references to CameraX and ML Kit Barcode Scanning
3. WHEN documentation is updated, THE Documentation System SHALL include a note explaining why barcode scanning was removed
4. WHEN documentation is updated, THE Documentation System SHALL preserve the decision rationale for future reference
