# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Meal Planning feature enables users to organize their meals across a weekly calendar by assigning meals from their library to specific dates and meal types (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack). This feature bridges the gap between the meal library and shopping list generation, allowing users to plan their week ahead and automatically generate shopping lists based on their planned meals.
