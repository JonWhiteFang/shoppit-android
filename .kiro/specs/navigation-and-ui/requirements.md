# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the navigation structure and main UI screens for the Shoppit Android application. The navigation system provides seamless transitions between the three main sections of the app (Meals, Planner, Shopping) and their associated detail screens. The UI follows Material3 design principles with a bottom navigation pattern for primary navigation and hierarchical navigation for detail screens.

## Glossary

- **Navigation System**: The framework that manages screen transitions and back stack in the application
- **Bottom Navigation Bar**: A Material3 component displaying primary navigation items at the bottom of the screen
- **NavHost**: The Compose component that hosts navigation destinations and manages screen transitions
- **Screen**: A composable function representing a distinct UI destination in the app
- **Route**: A unique string identifier for a navigation destination
- **Back Stack**: The history of navigation destinations that allows users to navigate backward
- **Deep Link**: A navigation path that can be triggered from outside the app or from specific entry points

4. WHEN a user taps the edit button on the meal detail screen, THE Navigation System SHALL navigate to the edit meal screen with the meal's current data
5. WHEN a user completes adding or editing a meal, THE Navigation System SHALL navigate back to the appropriate previous screen

### Requirement 3: Planner Section Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate through the meal planner and access meal details from planned meals, so that I can review and modify my weekly meal plan.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Planner tab is selected, THE Navigation System SHALL display the weekly meal planner screen
2. WHEN a user taps a planned meal in the calendar, THE Navigation System SHALL navigate to the meal detail screen for that meal
3. WHEN a user navigates back from a meal detail screen, THE Navigation System SHALL return to the planner screen with the same week view preserved
4. THE Navigation System SHALL maintain the selected week when navigating away and returning to the planner

### Requirement 4: Shopping Section Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate through shopping-related screens (list, history, templates, settings), so that I can manage my shopping list and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Shopping tab is selected, THE Navigation System SHALL display the shopping list screen
2. WHEN a user taps a meal source indicator on a shopping item, THE Navigation System SHALL navigate to the corresponding meal detail screen
3. WHEN a user accesses item history, THE Navigation System SHALL navigate to the item history screen
4. WHEN a user accesses template management, THE Navigation System SHALL navigate to the template manager screen
5. WHEN a user accesses store section settings, THE Navigation System SHALL navigate to the store section editor screen
6. WHEN a user enters shopping mode, THE Navigation System SHALL navigate to the shopping mode screen with simplified navigation

### Requirement 5: Back Navigation Behavior

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent and predictable back navigation behavior, so that I can easily return to previous screens without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user presses the system back button on a detail screen, THE Navigation System SHALL navigate to the previous screen in the back stack
2. WHEN a user presses the system back button on a main section screen (Meals, Planner, Shopping), THE Navigation System SHALL exit the application
3. WHEN a user navigates back from an add or edit screen without saving, THE Navigation System SHALL return to the previous screen without making changes
4. WHEN a user navigates back after saving changes, THE Navigation System SHALL return to the previous screen and reflect the updated data
5. THE Navigation System SHALL maintain a logical back stack that prevents circular navigation loops

### Requirement 6: Screen State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to remember my position and state within each section, so that I don't lose my place when switching between sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user switches between bottom navigation tabs, THE Navigation System SHALL preserve the scroll position and UI state of each section
2. WHEN a user returns to a section after navigating away, THE Navigation System SHALL restore the previous screen within that section's navigation stack
3. WHEN the app is backgrounded and restored, THE Navigation System SHALL maintain the current navigation state and screen position
4. THE Navigation System SHALL clear saved state only when explicitly requested by the user or when data is deleted
5. WHILE navigating within a section, THE Navigation System SHALL maintain independent back stacks for each bottom navigation item

### Requirement 7: Navigation Performance

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth and responsive navigation transitions, so that the app feels fast and polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates navigation, THE Navigation System SHALL complete the transition within 300 milliseconds
2. WHEN navigating between screens, THE Navigation System SHALL display smooth animations without frame drops
3. WHEN loading a new screen, THE Navigation System SHALL show loading indicators for operations exceeding 100 milliseconds
4. THE Navigation System SHALL preload frequently accessed screens to minimize transition delays
5. THE Navigation System SHALL handle rapid navigation requests without crashing or displaying incorrect screens

### Requirement 8: Deep Link Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access specific screens directly from notifications or external links, so that I can quickly navigate to relevant content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deep link is triggered, THE Navigation System SHALL navigate directly to the specified screen with appropriate parameters
2. WHEN a deep link points to a detail screen, THE Navigation System SHALL construct a proper back stack to allow logical back navigation
3. IF a deep link contains invalid parameters, THEN THE Navigation System SHALL navigate to the appropriate fallback screen
4. WHEN a deep link is triggered while the app is running, THE Navigation System SHALL navigate to the target screen from the current location
5. THE Navigation System SHALL support deep links for meal details, planner dates, and shopping list views

### Requirement 9: Accessibility Navigation

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want to navigate the app using assistive technologies, so that I can use all features independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using TalkBack, THE Navigation System SHALL announce screen transitions with descriptive labels
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation, THE Navigation System SHALL support tab-based navigation through all interactive elements
3. THE Navigation System SHALL provide content descriptions for all navigation elements
