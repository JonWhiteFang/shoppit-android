# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the data persistence and caching requirements for the Shoppit application. The system must provide reliable local storage using Room database with proper caching strategies, data integrity mechanisms, and migration support to ensure offline-first functionality and optimal performance.

## Glossary

- **Persistence Layer**: The data layer responsible for storing and retrieving application data from local storage
- **Room Database**: Android's SQLite abstraction library used for local data persistence
- **Cache Strategy**: The approach used to manage in-memory data to reduce database queries
- **Migration**: The process of updating database schema while preserving existing data
- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring data remains accurate, consistent, and valid throughout its lifecycle
- **Transaction**: An atomic database operation that either completes fully or rolls back entirely
- **Offline-First**: Architecture pattern where the app functions fully without network connectivity

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Migration Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic database migration handling, so that users don't lose data when the app updates with schema changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database schema version changes, THE Persistence Layer SHALL execute migration logic to preserve existing data
2. IF a migration fails, THEN THE Persistence Layer SHALL provide fallback to destructive migration with user notification
3. THE Persistence Layer SHALL log all migration operations for debugging purposes
4. THE Persistence Layer SHALL validate data integrity after migration completion

### Requirement 2: In-Memory Caching

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to respond quickly to my actions, so that I can efficiently manage my meals and shopping lists.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Persistence Layer SHALL implement in-memory caching for frequently accessed meal data
2. WHEN data is modified, THE Persistence Layer SHALL invalidate relevant cache entries
3. THE Persistence Layer SHALL limit cache size to prevent excessive memory usage
4. WHEN the app starts, THE Persistence Layer SHALL pre-load essential data into cache

### Requirement 3: Transaction Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data operations to complete fully or not at all, so that my meal and shopping list data remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple related database operations occur, THE Persistence Layer SHALL execute them within a single transaction
2. IF any operation in a transaction fails, THEN THE Persistence Layer SHALL roll back all changes
3. THE Persistence Layer SHALL ensure ACID properties for all database transactions
4. THE Persistence Layer SHALL handle concurrent transaction requests without data corruption

### Requirement 4: Data Validation and Integrity

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to prevent invalid data from being saved, so that my meal plans and shopping lists remain accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Persistence Layer SHALL validate all data before persisting to the database
2. THE Persistence Layer SHALL enforce foreign key constraints for relational data
3. THE Persistence Layer SHALL prevent duplicate entries based on business rules
4. WHEN validation fails, THE Persistence Layer SHALL return descriptive error messages

### Requirement 5: Backup and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be protected against corruption, so that I don't lose my meal plans and shopping lists.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Persistence Layer SHALL implement database checkpoint mechanism for data safety
2. THE Persistence Layer SHALL detect and recover from database corruption
3. THE Persistence Layer SHALL provide export functionality for user data backup
4. THE Persistence Layer SHALL support import functionality to restore backed-up data

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want database operations to complete quickly, so that the app feels responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Persistence Layer SHALL use database indices on frequently queried columns
2. THE Persistence Layer SHALL execute database operations on background threads
3. THE Persistence Layer SHALL batch multiple insert operations when possible
4. THE Persistence Layer SHALL monitor and log slow query performance for optimization

### Requirement 7: Data Cleanup and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to manage storage efficiently, so that it doesn't consume excessive device space.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Persistence Layer SHALL implement automatic cleanup of orphaned data
2. THE Persistence Layer SHALL provide vacuum operation to reclaim unused database space
3. THE Persistence Layer SHALL archive old data based on configurable retention policies
4. THE Persistence Layer SHALL monitor database size and alert when approaching limits
